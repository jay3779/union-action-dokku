# Project Constitution v1.0.0

**Project**: Terraform DigitalOcean Infrastructure + Speckit Ecosystem  
**Ratification Date**: 2025-10-16  
**Last Amended Date**: 2025-10-16  
**Status**: Active

---

## Executive Summary

This constitution establishes the non-negotiable principles and governance rules for all development, specification, and infrastructure management within the Terraform DigitalOcean + Speckit project.

**Core Mission**: Enable rapid, secure, and well-documented infrastructure deployment to DigitalOcean through Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) + AI-assisted development (MCP) + comprehensive feature specifications (Speckit).

---

## Principle 1: Security Is Non-Negotiable

**Definition**: All code, configurations, and deployments MUST implement security best practices. Credentials, secrets, and sensitive data MUST never be committed to version control or embedded in code/container images.

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:
- ✅ MUST use environment variables or `.gitignore`-protected files for API tokens and secrets
- ✅ MUST mark sensitive variables with `sensitive = true` in Terraform
- ✅ MUST encrypt secrets at rest and in transit
- ✅ MUST implement least-privilege principles (no root access in containers, restricted firewall rules)
- ✅ MUST scan Docker images for vulnerabilities before deployment
- ✅ MUST never hardcode credentials in specifications, code, or documentation examples
- ✅ Any security breach (leaked token, exposed secret) MUST be red-flagged immediately

**Rationale**: Credential exposure creates direct infrastructure attack vectors. Production systems are only secure if secrets never leave the credential management system.

---

## Principle 2: Production-Ready Defaults

**Definition**: All infrastructure deployments MUST follow production-grade standards by default. No "bare minimum" deployments; every resource MUST include monitoring, backup, security controls, and recovery procedures.

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:
- ✅ MUST include VPC networking (no public exposure)
- ✅ MUST include firewall configuration (restrict inbound/outbound)
- ✅ MUST include SSL/HTTPS by default
- ✅ MUST include health checks and auto-restart
- ✅ MUST include monitoring and logging
- ✅ MUST include backup strategy
- ✅ MUST include rollback capability
- ✅ Development environments MUST match production patterns (scaled down, not different)

**Rationale**: Production failures often stem from "development shortcuts" promoted to production. Starting with production standards prevents this class of failure.

---

## Principle 3: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Governance

**Definition**: All infrastructure MUST be defined in Terraform code, version-controlled in Git, and deployable via CI/CD. Manual infrastructure changes or UI-based deployments are prohibited.

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:
- ✅ MUST use Terraform for all DigitalOcean resource definitions
- ✅ MUST follow naming convention: `{project_name}-{description}-{environment}`
- ✅ MUST organize code with consistent structure (providers.tf, variables.tf, main.tf, outputs.tf, modules/)
- ✅ MUST version lock Terraform provider versions
- ✅ MUST commit ALL infrastructure changes to Git
- ✅ MUST require `terraform plan` review before `terraform apply`
- ✅ MUST store state files securely (never in Git)
- ✅ Manual infrastructure changes (through DigitalOcean UI) MUST be flagged as drift and corrected

**Rationale**: IaC enables reproducibility, auditability, and rollback. Git commit history becomes infrastructure deployment history.

---

## Principle 4: Comprehensive Specifications

**Definition**: All features MUST be specified using Speckit framework before development begins. Specifications MUST pass 30/30 quality checklist items (10/10 across all dimensions) before moving to development phase.

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:
- ✅ MUST include 8+ functional requirements
- ✅ MUST include 4+ user scenarios with acceptance criteria
- ✅ MUST include 10+ measurable success criteria
- ✅ MUST document 5+ edge cases with recovery procedures
- ✅ MUST document 3+ error scenarios
- ✅ MUST document non-functional aspects (performance, security, usability, reliability)
- ✅ MUST have zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- ✅ MUST score 10/10 across completeness, clarity, testability, user value, and security
- ✅ Specifications with ANY failing checklist items MUST NOT proceed to development
- ✅ Any breach of specification quality standards MUST be red-flagged

**Rationale**: Comprehensive specs prevent development surprises. Clear requirements reduce rework and accelerate development.

---

## Principle 5: Multi-Environment Readiness

**Definition**: All infrastructure and deployments MUST support dev/staging/production environments with appropriate resource sizing, secrets isolation, and configuration management.

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:
- ✅ MUST use `environment` variable to differentiate dev/staging/prod
- ✅ MUST apply different resource sizes per environment (prod > staging > dev)
- ✅ MUST apply environment-specific secrets and configurations
- ✅ MUST tag resources with environment identifier
- ✅ MUST deploy to dev first, then staging, then prod
- ✅ MUST never skip environment stages (dev → prod directly prohibited)
- ✅ Development environment infrastructure MUST match production patterns

**Rationale**: Environment separation prevents development mistakes from reaching production. Staged rollouts catch issues early.

---

## Principle 6: Documentation Is Mandatory

**Definition**: All code, infrastructure, and features MUST be comprehensively documented. Documentation MUST be kept in sync with code. Undocumented code or infrastructure is considered incomplete.

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:
- ✅ MUST include inline comments for complex logic
- ✅ MUST document all variables and their valid values
- ✅ MUST provide examples for configuration files
- ✅ MUST maintain README with setup instructions
- ✅ MUST provide deployment guides for new deployments
- ✅ MUST document troubleshooting procedures for common issues
- ✅ MUST keep documentation in sync with code (docs + code updated together)
- ✅ Any documentation drift MUST be flagged

**Rationale**: Undocumented infrastructure is fragile and creates tribal knowledge. Documentation enables team scaling and onboarding.

---

## Principle 7: AI-Assisted Development With Human Review

**Definition**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) and AI tools MUST be used to accelerate development, but ALL generated code MUST be reviewed and validated by humans before deployment.

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:
- ✅ MUST use Terraform MCP for code generation based on specifications
- ✅ MUST review all AI-generated code for security, correctness, and alignment with specs
- ✅ MUST run `terraform validate` and `terraform plan` before any deployment
- ✅ MUST run quality checklists on all generated specifications
- ✅ MUST ensure generated code matches specification requirements exactly
- ✅ Any AI-generated code that fails validation MUST be fixed before deployment
- ✅ Cursor rules and constitution MUST guide AI code generation

**Rationale**: AI acceleration improves velocity, but human oversight catches edge cases and ensures security.

---

## Principle 8: Testability and Validation

**Definition**: All specifications and code MUST be testable against concrete success criteria. Success criteria MUST be measurable and technology-agnostic.

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:
- ✅ MUST define testable acceptance criteria for all requirements
- ✅ MUST include concrete examples in acceptance scenarios
- ✅ MUST measure success against quantified metrics (time, count, percentage, cost)
- ✅ MUST avoid vague language ("should", "can", "may") in favor of "MUST" or "MUST NOT"
- ✅ MUST unit test all code
- ✅ MUST integration test all specifications
- ✅ MUST perform end-to-end testing before production deployment
- ✅ Test results MUST be documented

**Rationale**: Measurable acceptance criteria prevent subjective quality disputes. Clear metrics enable confident deployment decisions.
