# Specification Quality Checklist: Autonomous Deploy

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: 
- Specification maintains focus on outcomes (automated deployments, safety gates) not implementation (GitHub Actions YAML, Terraform state file formats)
- Benefits clearly articulated for each stakeholder (DevOps, Developers, Security, Infrastructure)
- Technical terms (CI/CD, gated apply, Drop Deploy DO) explained in glossary and context

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: 
- 8 functional requirements each with 7-11 acceptance criteria (testable checkboxes)
- 3 detailed user scenarios covering: PR validation, Drop Deploy app deployment, environment promotion
- 4 edge cases and 2 error scenarios with recovery paths
- Clear In Scope / Out of Scope boundaries (Phase 2 features identified)
- 9 assumptions and 6 constraints documented
- 8 measurable success criteria (e.g., "< 10 minutes", "zero production incidents", "> 90% automation coverage")

---

## Feature Readiness

---

## Feature Clarity & Alignment

- [x] Problem statement clearly articulated

- [x] Scope boundaries explicitly defined
- [x] Key entities with attributes and relationships documented
- [x] Glossary resolves ambiguous terminology
- [x] Appendix links to related specifications and enhancement doc

**Notes**:
- Problem: Manual deployments, local state risks, lack of validation gates, no automated app deployment
- Value: Automation + safety (developers) vs autonomy + visibility (DevOps) vs enforcement (Security)
- 3 key entities: CI/CD Pipeline, Environment, Application with clear attributes and relationships
- Glossary includes 7 key terms essential for understanding the feature
- Links to enhancement-spec-autonomous.md, ENHANCEMENT_VARIABLES.md, and project constitution

---

## Success Criteria Validation

All 8 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:

- [x] "CI/CD Confidence": Green checks (measurable), developer confidence (qualitative outcome)
- [x] "Gated Safety": Zero production incidents (measurable), safety gates documented
- [x] "State Security": Zero state conflicts (measurable), locking prevents corruption (verifiable)
- [x] "Security Enforcement": Zero critical findings (measurable), enforcement automatic (verifiable)
- [x] "Module Consistency": Root uses modules (verifiable), modules in production use (measurable)
- [x] "Drop Deploy Success": < 10 minutes deployment time (measurable), prod-like environment (testable)
- [x] "Environment Isolation": Separate secrets per env (verifiable), no exposure (testable)
- [x] "Automation Coverage": > 90% automation (measurable), zero manual intervention (testable)

---

## Testing Alignment

Specification supports clear testing strategy:

- [x] Unit-level: Terraform validate, module composition checks (Requirement 5)
- [x] Integration: Plan shows expected resources, apply produces outputs (Requirements 1-6)
- [x] Security: tfsec/checkov no critical findings (Requirement 3)
- [x] E2E: Drop Deploy sample app successfully deployed (Requirement 8)
- [x] Rollback: Previous version restored on health check failure (Edge Case 4)

## Cross-Spec Consistency

- [x] Aligns with project constitution (8 principles: Security, Production-Ready Defaults, IaC Governance, etc.)
- [x] Implements enhancement-spec-autonomous.md requirements
- [x] Compatible with terraform-mcp-do specification (existing droplet, VPC, firewall resources)
- [x] Extends drop-deploy-do specification (app deployment automation)
- [x] Variables documented in ENHANCEMENT_VARIABLES.md

**Notes**:
- Constitution Principle 1 (Security): Gated applies (Req 1), firewall hardening (Req 4), secrets management (Req 7)
- Constitution Principle 2 (Production-Ready): Multi-env promotion (Req 6), zero-downtime deploys (Req 8), monitoring
- Constitution Principle 3 (IaC Governance): Remote state (Req 2), module consistency (Req 5), security scanning (Req 3)
- Leverages existing modules/droplet and extends with modules/load_balancer and modules/database

---

## Documentation Quality

- [x] Clear problem statement
- [x] Concrete user scenarios with step-by-step flows
- [x] Functional requirements match enhancement spec scope
- [x] Related documents and references provided
- [x] Technical glossary resolves domain terms
- [x] Implementation variables documented separately

**Notes**:
- Each scenario includes: Actor, Trigger, 13-step flow, Outcome
- Each requirement includes: Description, 7-11 acceptance criteria
- Related documents: Enhancement spec, variables doc, constitution
- Glossary bridges gap between business language and technical implementation

## Risk Assessment

**Low-Risk Areas**:
- [x] Remote state backend (Terraform standard, well-documented)
- [x] GitHub Actions CI/CD (standard GitHub offering)
- [x] Environment promotion (standard DevOps pattern)
- [x] Secrets management (GitHub Environments standard)

**Medium-Risk Areas**:
- [ ] Drop Deploy DO automatic Dockerfile generation (requires framework detection)
- [ ] Health check configuration (timing sensitive, failure recovery critical)
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployment coordination (requires careful orchestration)

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Drop Deploy: Use simple framework detection (Node/Python/Ruby/Go/Static), templates for Dockerfile generation
- Health checks: Configurable timeouts, automatic rollback on failure, detailed logging
- Zero-downtime: Use proven patterns (blue-green, rolling updates), test in dev/staging first

## Sign-Off

**Specification Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

**Quality Assessment**: All mandatory sections complete, no clarifications needed, fully aligned with project constitution and enhancement specification.

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Run `/speckit.plan` to convert specification into detailed implementation plan
2. Create implementation tasks for Phase 1 (Backend, CI/CD, Security, Secrets)
3. Assign ownership to DevOps/Security team for review
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation (Weeks 1-2)
