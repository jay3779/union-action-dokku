## Overview

An intelligent application deployment system that automatically detects, containerizes, and deploys user-provided application directories to DigitalOcean with minimal configuration.

### Problem Statement

Developers with MVP or production-ready applications face barriers to deployment: infrastructure planning, containerization, networking setup, and ongoing management. Time spent on deployment infrastructure takes away from product development. Teams want "drop and deploy" simplicity while maintaining production-grade infrastructure and security.

### User Value

Users can:
- Deploy applications instantly without infrastructure knowledge
- Automatically detect application type and generate appropriate Terraform
- Create production-ready infrastructure with one action
- Focus on application code, not deployment complexity
- Scale from MVP to production with infrastructure already in place
- Maintain version history and rollback capability

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- Directory drop/detection interface
- Application type detection (Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, etc.)
- Automatic Dockerfile generation if needed
- Docker image building and registry push
- DigitalOcean App Platform integration or droplet-based deployment
- Terraform code generation for infrastructure
- Environment variable and secrets management
- Database provisioning (PostgreSQL/MySQL) if detected
- SSL/HTTPS automatic setup
- Deployment orchestration and status monitoring
- Rollback to previous deployments
- Health checking and auto-restart configuration
- Cost estimation before deployment

### Out of Scope

- Custom machine learning model deployment
- GPU-accelerated workloads
- Kubernetes cluster setup
- Complex multi-region failover
- On-premises deployment
- Manual terraform code editing after generation
- Performance tuning and optimization consultation
- Application source code modification

---

## User Scenarios

### Primary User Flow: First-Time App Deploy

**Actor**: Developer with completed MVP wanting to deploy to production

**Trigger**: User drags directory to deployment interface or runs deployment command

**Steps**:
1. User selects or drags application directory
2. System scans for framework detection (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
3. System displays detected app type with confirmation
4. User enters app name and domain (optional)
5. System generates Dockerfile (if needed) and shows preview
6. System generates Terraform configuration
7. System displays cost estimate and infrastructure details
8. User reviews and approves
9. System creates DigitalOcean resources (droplet/app platform)
10. System builds and pushes Docker image
11. System deploys application
12. System displays live URL and access information
13. Feature complete - app live in production

**Outcome**: Application deployed and accessible within minutes

### Secondary User Flow: Update Existing Deployment

**Actor**: Developer with running application wanting to deploy new version

**Trigger**: User drops updated app directory

**Steps**:
1. User drops updated directory
2. System detects existing deployment
3. System compares with previous version
4. System prompts for deployment strategy (rolling update, blue-green, etc.)
5. System builds new image
6. System deploys with chosen strategy
7. System performs health checks
8. System shows deployment status
9. Feature complete - new version live

**Outcome**: Application updated with zero downtime

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Node.js App Detection and Deployment**

**Given**: User has Node.js application with package.json
**When**: User drops directory on deploy interface
**Then**: System detects Node.js, generates Dockerfile, creates droplet, deploys app

**Scenario 2: Database Auto-Provisioning**

**Given**: Application includes database connection strings or ORMs
**When**: System detects database requirements
**Then**: System creates managed PostgreSQL database, configures networking, injects connection strings

**Scenario 3: Environment-Specific Configuration**

**Given**: Different configurations needed for dev/staging/prod
**When**: User specifies environment
**Then**: System adjusts resource sizes, creates appropriate secrets, scales accordingly

**Scenario 4: Deployment Failure Rollback**

**Given**: New deployment fails health checks
**When**: System detects failures
**Then**: System automatically rolls back to previous version, notifies user with error logs

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Edge Case 1: Directory Contains Multiple Applications

**Expected Behavior**: System prompts user to select main application directory, or offers multi-app deployment

### Edge Case 2: Dependency Conflicts During Build

**Condition**: Docker build fails due to incompatible dependencies

**Expected Behavior**: Build failure displayed with logs; user prompted to resolve or customize Dockerfile

### Edge Case 3: Application Won't Start in Container

**Condition**: Application runs locally but fails in container environment

**Expected Behavior**: Application logs displayed; user offered options (customize Dockerfile, adjust environment variables)

### Edge Case 4: Database Connection Issues

**Condition**: Application detects database but can't connect to provisioned database

**Expected Behavior**: Networking validated; connection string verified; automated troubleshooting suggestions provided

### Edge Case 5: Deployment Takes Longer Than Expected

**Condition**: Build or deployment exceeds normal time

**Expected Behavior**: User can monitor progress; option to increase timeouts; partial deployment failure handled gracefully

### Error Scenario 1: DigitalOcean API Unavailable

**Error**: Cannot create resources due to API outage

**Recovery**: Error displayed with retry option; Terraform state preserved for manual recovery

### Error Scenario 2: Docker Image Push Fails

**Error**: Image exceeds registry size quota or network error

**Recovery**: User offered to clean up old images; retry with backoff strategy

### Error Scenario 3: Health Checks Fail

**Error**: Application starts but doesn't respond to health checks

**Recovery**: Automatic rollback to previous version; application logs provided for debugging
