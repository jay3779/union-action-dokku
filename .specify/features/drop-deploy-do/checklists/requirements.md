## Notes

### Feature Overview

This specification defines a comprehensive application deployment system that transforms the process from complex multi-step infrastructure management to intuitive "drop and deploy" simplicity.

### Key Innovation

Combines intelligent application detection with automatic infrastructure generation and deployment orchestration, bridging the gap between development and production.

### Scope Management

Clear boundaries prevent scope creep:
- ✅ In Scope: Auto-detection, containerization, standard frameworks
- ✅ Out of Scope: ML models, GPU workloads, K8s, multi-region

### User-Centric Design

Two primary workflows address both initial deployment and continuous updates:
1. First-time MVP deployment (13 steps to production)
2. Update existing deployment (9 steps with zero downtime)

### Safety-First Approach

Multiple layers of protection:
- Automated health checks
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Cost estimates before commitment
- Production-quality defaults

### Requirement Coverage

- **8 major requirements** addressing all aspects
- **4 acceptance scenarios** with concrete examples
- **5 edge cases** with mitigation strategies
- **3 error scenarios** with recovery procedures
- **10 success criteria** spanning all concerns

### Non-Functional Completeness

- Performance: 5-minute deployment target
- Usability: Clear UX patterns and error messages
- Security: Secrets management, encryption, audit logs
- Reliability: Automatic retries, atomic deployments, backups
