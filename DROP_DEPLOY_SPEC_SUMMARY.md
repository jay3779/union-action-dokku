## 📋 What This Feature Does

Enables developers to deploy applications to DigitalOcean with zero infrastructure knowledge:

1. **Drop Directory** → User drags application folder
2. **Auto-Detect** → System identifies framework (Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Java)
3. **Generate** → System creates Dockerfile + Terraform infrastructure
4. **Deploy** → One-click production deployment
5. **Monitor** → Health checks, logs, cost tracking, rollback capability

**Time**: From "drop" to "live" in under 5 minutes

## 🏗️ Architectural Patterns

### Input Detection
```
Directory → Framework Detection → Type Confirmation
```

### Processing
```
Type → Dockerfile Generation → Terraform Generation → Cost Estimate
```

### Deployment
```
Build → Push Image → Create Infrastructure → Deploy → Verify
```

### Health Management
```
Health Checks → Success Path → Live
                    ↓
                Failures → Rollback → Notify
```

---

## 📋 Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Node.js App**: Drop directory with package.json → System detects Node.js → Deploy succeeds
2. **Database Detection**: Django app with SQLAlchemy → PostgreSQL auto-provisioned → Connections work
3. **Environment Config**: Staging vs Production → Different sizes/secrets → Correct values injected
4. **Deployment Failure**: New deployment fails health checks → System rolls back → Previous version live again
