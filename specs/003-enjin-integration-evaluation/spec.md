## Deep Technical Analysis

### Enjin Platform Architecture Compatibility

**Enjin Platform API Integration:**
- **Current System**: REST API with FastAPI endpoints (`/escalate`, `/deploy`, `/health`)
- **Enjin Platform**: GraphQL API with platform-level operations (no direct blockchain interaction)
- **Integration Approach**: Implement GraphQL client using Python libraries (httpx, gql) to interface with Enjin Platform API
- **Key Operations**: Platform-level NFT creation, collection management, and asset distribution through Enjin's abstraction layer

**Platform Integration:**
- **Current System**: Stateless API with agent-driven workflow orchestration

- **Enjin Platform Models**: Platform-level NFT metadata, collection structures, asset references
- **Transformation Strategy**: Map ethical analysis results to platform-level NFT metadata, convert survey URLs to platform asset references

### Technical Implementation Requirements

**Python GraphQL Client:**
```python
# Example integration pattern
import httpx
from gql import gql, Client
from gql.transport.httpx import HTTPXTransport

# Enjin GraphQL client setup
transport = HTTPXTransport(url="https://platform.enjin.io/graphql")
client = Client(transport=transport, fetch_schema_from_transport=True)
```

**Platform NFT Creation Workflow:**
1. Transform `EthicalAnalysisReport` to platform-level NFT metadata
2. Create collection via platform API
3. Mint NFT via platform API with ethical analysis data
