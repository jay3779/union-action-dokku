# Feature Specification: Dokku Deploy Provision

**Feature Branch**: `001-dokku-deploy-provision`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "provision union-action to deploy to @Dokku"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Deploy Union Action API to Dokku (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to deploy the union-action FastAPI service to a Dokku server so that the application is accessible via HTTP endpoints and can be managed through standard git-based deployment workflows.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without deployment, the application cannot be used. This enables the entire workflow integration system to function.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by successfully deploying the application and verifying all endpoints are accessible via HTTP, delivering a working API service.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Dokku server is available, **When** I push the union-action code to the Dokku remote, **Then** the application builds successfully and starts running
2. **Given** the application is deployed, **When** I access the health endpoint, **Then** I receive a successful health check response
3. **Given** the application is deployed, **When** I access the API documentation, **Then** I can view the interactive API docs at /docs

---

### User Story 2 - Configure Environment Variables (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want to configure environment variables for the deployed application so that it can connect to external services and operate with the correct settings.

**Why this priority**: The application requires specific environment configuration to function properly with external services like Typeform and AI models.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting environment variables and verifying the application uses them correctly, delivering proper service integration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is deployed, **When** I set the TYPEFORM_API_TOKEN environment variable, **Then** the application can connect to Typeform services
2. **Given** the application is deployed, **When** I set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable, **Then** the application can use AI transformer services
3. **Given** the application is deployed, **When** I set the LOG_LEVEL environment variable, **Then** the application logs at the specified level

---

### User Story 3 - Access Workflow Endpoints (Priority: P2)

As a system integrator, I want to access the workflow endpoints (/escalate and /deploy) so that I can integrate the union-action service with other systems in the workflow.

**Why this priority**: These endpoints provide the core business functionality for complaint escalation and survey generation workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making HTTP requests to the workflow endpoints and verifying they return expected responses, delivering functional workflow integration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is deployed, **When** I POST to /escalate with valid complaint data, **Then** I receive a successful response for complaint escalation
2. **Given** the application is deployed, **When** I POST to /deploy with valid survey data, **Then** I receive a successful response for KOERS survey generation
3. **Given** the application is deployed, **When** I POST with invalid data, **Then** I receive appropriate validation error responses

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the Dokku server is unavailable during deployment?
- How does the system handle Docker build failures?
- What happens when required environment variables are missing?
- How does the system handle port conflicts on the Dokku server?
- What happens when the application fails to start after successful build?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST deploy the union-action FastAPI application to a Dokku server using git push workflow
- **FR-002**: System MUST build the application using the existing Dockerfile without modification
- **FR-003**: System MUST expose the application on port 80/443 through Dokku's built-in proxy
- **FR-004**: System MUST support configuration of environment variables through Dokku's config system
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide health check endpoint at /health for monitoring
- **FR-006**: System MUST support the three main API endpoints: /health, /escalate, /deploy
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle CORS requests for cross-origin access
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide API documentation at /docs endpoint
- **FR-009**: System MUST support graceful shutdown and restart through Dokku commands
- **FR-010**: System MUST log application events with configurable log levels

### Key Entities

- **Dokku Application**: Represents the deployed union-action service with its configuration, environment variables, and runtime state
- **Environment Configuration**: Contains API tokens, model settings, and logging configuration required for service operation
- **API Endpoints**: Health monitoring, complaint escalation, and survey generation endpoints that provide the core workflow functionality

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Application deploys successfully to Dokku within 5 minutes of git push
- **SC-002**: All API endpoints respond within 2 seconds under normal load
- **SC-003**: Health check endpoint returns successful status 99% of the time
- **SC-004**: Application can handle 100 concurrent requests without degradation
- **SC-005**: Environment variables can be configured and applied without application restart
- **SC-006**: API documentation is accessible and functional for all endpoints
- **SC-007**: Application logs provide sufficient detail for troubleshooting and monitoring
- **SC-008**: Deployment process can be repeated reliably through standard git workflow
